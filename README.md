##### Reasoning

I'm not too opinionated in the sense that I think I know better than everyone, but in true don't repeat yourself fashion I'm trying to make a collection of recommendations. This is a long term project, so expect small additions often. 

Pull requests are welcome, but will be based on my taste.
