| [HPMOR](http://hpmor.com) | This took the throne of being my favourite book this year. Harrowing. Beautiful. I can discuss it at length. Fan-fiction, no joke. Great. |

| [The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined](http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1455883115) | If there was a book I could wish everyone would read so we could talk about it all day, it is this. Changed my world view.|
| [The Stuff of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stuff_of_Thought) | I read this when [learning Portuguese](http://orta.github.io/on/being/23/) and found it helped cement a lot of hard language ideas.|
